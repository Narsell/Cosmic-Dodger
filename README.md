# GAME_NAME_HERE_PLACEHOLDER

GAME_NAME_HERE_PLACEHOLDER is a simple 2D game where you attempt to navigate a asteroid field while collecting points and survive as long as you can.

This game is mainly a way for me to learn C++ and game programming/computer graphics. It was made using SDL2 with C++


## Controls
- **Left Click** to shoot
- **W** to move forward
- **Aim your mouse** to navigate your ship
