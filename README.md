# COSMIC DODGER

Cosmic Dodger is a simple 2D game where you collect stars while navigating an increasingly frenetic asteroid field.

You can play now on my itch.io!

This project is an effort to learn more about low-level game development. It was made using SDL2 and C++.


## Controls
- **Left Click** to shoot
- **Aim your mouse** to navigate your ship and press **W** to move forward.

## HOW TO BUILD
I plan to add a premake setup for this project. However, right now there is no streamlined method to compile this project other than importing it into Visual Studio and adding the include paths and linker settings for SDL2.
